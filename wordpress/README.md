# Deploy the Bitnami Wordpress chart using custom values

## References:

* [Bitnami WordPress](https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress/helm) documentation.
* Bitnami WordPress[GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/wordpress/).

## Important TIP

As you debug, you may need to install and uninstall the chart a few times until things are working. __Use a unique release name for each attempt__ or data stored in the persistent volume claim from the previous attempt may cause issues. 

## Instructions

- [ ] Open a terminal navigate to the `wordpress` directory (the one with this file.)
- [ ] Populate the [values.yaml](values.yaml) file with custom values for these parameters:

    | Key | Value |
    |-----|-------|
    | wordpressUsername | supply your *first name* in all lower case (i.e. `jeff`) |
    | wordpressPassword | `T0p$3cr3t`
    | wordpressEmail | your Columbus State student email address |
    | wordpressFirstName | Your first name (i.e. `Jeff`) |
    | wordpressLastName | Your last name (i.e. `Anderson`) |
    | wordpressBlogName | Give it a name unique to your (i.e. `Jeff's Blog`) or something more fun and creative |
    | service.type | NodePort |
    | service.nodePorts.http | 30080 |
    | service.nodePorts.https | 30443 |

- [ ] Using the [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) command, install the chart using the custom values in the `values.yaml` file.

- [ ] Copy the command you used, and the output generated and paste it below:

```
helm install -f values.yaml first-release oci://registry-1.docker.io/bitnamicharts/wordpress

** Please be patient while the chart is being deployed **

Your WordPress site can be accessed through the following DNS name from within your cluster:

    first-release-wordpress.default.svc.cluster.local (port 80)

To access your WordPress site from outside the cluster follow the steps below:

1. Get the WordPress URL by running these commands:

   export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get --namespace default -o jsonpath="{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}" services first-release-wordpress)
   export NODE_IP=$(kubectl get nodes --namespace default -o jsonpath="{.items[0].status.addresses[0].address}")
   echo "WordPress URL: http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/"
   echo "WordPress Admin URL: http://$NODE_IP:$NODE_PORT/admin"

2. Open a browser and access WordPress using the obtained URL.

3. Login with the following credentials below to see your blog:

  echo Username: derek
  echo Password: $(kubectl get secret --namespace default first-release-wordpress -o jsonpath="{.data.wordpress-password}" | base64 -d)
```

- [ ] Using `minikube service list`, get the URL to your application. 

- [ ] Open the URL in your browser and make sure it's working.

- [ ] From a terminal running in this directory, overwrite [my-manifest.txt](my-manifest.txt) with the contents generated by this command: `helm get manifest *Your-Release-Name-Here* > my-manifest.txt`.

- [ ] Use the [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) command to uninstall your chart.

- [ ] Copy the command you used, and the output generated and paste it below:

```
helm uninstall first-release
release "first-release" uninstalled
```
